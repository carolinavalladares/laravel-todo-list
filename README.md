# Laravel to-do list application with auth

A simple to-do list application with authentication.

I built this project to gain a better understanding of Laravel's workflow as well as learning about authentication in Laravel projects.

### Project setup

1. Run `composer install` command;
2. Run `cp .env.example .env` command;
3. Run `php artisan key:generate` command;
4. Run `php artisan migrate` command;

To start the project run `php artisan serve`. The project will be up and running on **localhost:8000**.
